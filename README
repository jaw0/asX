Congratulations!
You are now the proud owner of a beautiful set of cross assemblers for
the 8048 and 8096/196 families of intel MCU's.

It is synatactilly similar to the UN*X assembler "as", with C like
expressions, and suchlikes.

It is written in C++ and has been compiled with/on:
	Sun[34] with
			Sun's CC
			GNU's gcc(2.3, 2.4)

To build:

-	edit the Makefile as you see fit, making sure one or both
	of 48 or 96 is on the TARGET line.

-	type "make"

-	wait

-	enjoy! (send in bug report)


Now how much would you pay?
But wait that's not all, you also get:

	a set of *Beautiful* header files defining all of the
	8096/196 SFRs and bit locations!

	a handcrafted leather easy chair (while supplies last)
